#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib> // for rand function
using namespace std;

// Hint: This function should generate a random number between 1 and 6.
// Use rand() % 6 to get a number between 0-5 and then add 1 to shift it to 1-6.
// Example: return (rand() % 6) + 1;
int rollDie(){}
// Hint: This function should roll 'numberOfDice' times and return the total sum.
// Steps:
// 1. Initialize a variable 'total' to 0.
// 2. Use a for loop to roll the dice 'numberOfDice' times.
// 3. Each time, call rollDie() to get a random number and add it to 'total'.
// 4. Print each roll to show the player what was rolled.
// 5. Return the 'total' after the loop.
int rollMultipleDice(int numberOfDice){}
// Hint: This function plays one round of the game and returns the result.
// Steps:   
// 1. Call rollMultipleDice(2) to get the player’s total.
// 2. Call rollMultipleDice(2) to get the computer’s total.
// 3. Compare the totals:
//    - If player > computer, return 1 (win)
//    - If player == computer, return 0 (draw)
//    - Otherwise, return -1 (loss)
// 4. The main function will use this result to update scores.
int playRound(){}
// Hint: This function allows the player to spend points for bonuses.
// Steps:
// 1. Display the shop menu with options and costs.
// 2. Read the player’s choice.
// 3. Use an if-else or switch statement to handle choices:
//    - Option 1: If player has enough points (>=5), deduct 5 points and add +5 points as a bonus.
//    - Option 2: If player has enough points (>=10), deduct 10 points and add +15 points as a bonus.
//    - Option 3: Exit the shop without changes.
//    - Invalid input: Show an error and exit.
// 4. Return the updated score to the main function.
int shop(int currentScore){}
// Hint: This function shows the final game results after the player is done.
// Steps:
// 1. Print the total number of rounds played.
// 2. Print how many rounds the player won, drew, and lost.
// 3. Display the final score.
// No return value is needed since it's just displaying information.
void displayStatistics(int totalRounds, int wins, int draws, int losses, int finalScore){}

int main() {
    // 1. Initialize variables:
    //    - score: to track player’s points
    //    - rounds: to track how many rounds have been played
    //    - wins, draws, losses: to track the game outcomes

    // 2. Use srand(time(0)) to seed the random number generator for different results each time.

    // 3. Use a while loop to keep the game running while the user wants to play:
    //    a. Increment the round counter.
    //    b. Ask the player if they want to visit the shop.
    //       - If yes, call the shop function and update the score.
    //    c. Call playRound() to play one round of dice.
    //       - Based on the returned result, update score, wins, draws, or losses.
    //    d. Display the current score.
    //    e. Ask the player if they want to play another round.

    // 4. After the loop ends, call displayStatistics() to show final game results.
